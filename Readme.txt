The goal is to write a parser in Java that parses web server access log file, loads the log to MySQL
and checks if a given IP makes more than a certain number of requests for the given duration. 
Java
----

(1) Create a java tool that can parse and load the given log file to MySQL. The delimiter of the log file is pipe (|)

(2) The tool takes "accesslog", "startDate", "duration" and "threshold" as command line arguments. "startDate" is of "yyyy-MM-dd.HH:mm:ss" format, "duration" can take only "hourly", "daily" as inputs and "threshold" can be an integer, "accesslog" takes path to the log file. 

(3) This is how the tool works:

    java -jar c:/parser.jar --accesslog=c:/../../access.log --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=hourly --threshold=100
	
	The tool will find any IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00 (one hour)
  and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.

	java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=daily --threshold=250

	The tool will find any IPs that made more than 250 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-02.13:00:00 (24 hours)
  and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.
  
  LOG Format
----------
Date, IP, Request, Status, User Agent (pipe delimited, open the example file in text editor)

Date Format: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"

Also, please find attached a log file for your reference. 

The log file assumes 200 as hourly limit and 500 as daily limit.
